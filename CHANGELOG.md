# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `claude account status` shows each profile's 5-hour and weekly subscription
  usage with progress bars and reset times. It reads each profile's OAuth
  access token for one request to Anthropic's usage endpoint and never stores
  or refreshes it.
- `claude account auto` switches to the profile with the most usage available
  over the next five hours, taking the weekly limit into account.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- macOS account isolation with a Claude Code 2.1.144 minimum-version guard for
  profile-scoped Keychain credentials.
- Native CI and release archives for Apple Silicon and Intel macOS.
- An explicit `resolve-case-collision` recovery command for legacy state that
  contains names differing only by ASCII letter case.
- Native macOS storage under `~/Library/Application Support/claude-account`,
  compatible with OAuth profiles created by `Kerber0ss/claude-account-macos`.
- Automatic reuse of an existing XDG-style macOS installation when it is the
  only existing account registry.

### Changed

- Reject macOS profile names that differ only by ASCII letter case to prevent
  collisions on case-insensitive filesystems.
- Force managed Claude processes to use the selected profile's configuration
  and secure-storage directories, and ignore inherited authentication tokens
  unless `CLAUDE_ACCOUNT_PRESERVE_AUTH_ENV=1` is set.
- Print shell startup guidance for both zsh and Bash.

### Fixed

- Serialize `account use` with profile removal so concurrent commands cannot
  leave the active profile pointing to a removed account.
- Fail closed when both native and XDG-style macOS account registries exist,
  rather than selecting one silently.
- Detect API profiles created by `claude-account-macos` and reject them without
  reading or migrating their API keys; OAuth profiles remain compatible.

### Contributors

- macOS behavior and native layout were validated by
  [@Kerber0ss](https://github.com/Kerber0ss).
- Cross-platform isolation and test hardening were contributed by
  [@Yiminnn](https://github.com/Yiminnn).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Complete Claude Code onboarding after a verified `account add` login so the
  first normal `claude` launch does not ask the user to authenticate again.
- Require `auth status --json` to explicitly report `loggedIn: true` before a
  profile is registered.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Linux-only Claude Code profile isolation through `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.
- `add`, `use`, `list`, `current`, and `remove` account commands.
- Transparent forwarding of normal Claude Code commands and arguments.
- Official Claude Code login, status verification, and logout integration.
- Atomic state writes, process locking, strict filesystem permissions, and
  profile-name validation.
- Safe profile removal with separate unregister and permanent purge modes.
- Non-invasive shim installation that preserves the official Claude launcher.
- Unit and end-to-end lifecycle tests.
